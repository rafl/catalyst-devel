This file documents the revision history for Perl extension Catalyst-Devel.

1.25  2010-01-02 16:13:06
        - Update repository metadata after moving from svn to git.

1.24  2009-12-07 23:23:36
        - File name for .yml file generated is now correct.
        - Fixes for consistent spacing in generated application template.
        - Stop requiring generated test files to have a true return value.
        - Win32 compatibility fixes:
          1) hardcoded 'make' replaced by: $Config{make}||'make'
          2) testing executable flags skipped on Win32
        - Fix pod to match option names on Catalyst::Script::Server

1.23  2009-12-06 12:22:12
        - Fix generated app test to be multi-platform and fix issue with case
          for generated files. (Dave Rolsky)
        - Fix Test::More version dependency so that subtest works correctly.
        - Add a $VERSION to Catalyst::Helper as PAUSE used to pull $VERSION
          (i.e. 0.01) out of the app template section and use that, so we now
          can't not have a version number here or it makes pause unhappy.

1.22  2009-12-05 07:23:00
        - Use MooseX::Emulate::Class::Accessor::Fast so that options
          supplied to ->new are put into the hash even if attributes
          do not exist for them. This fixes -force recreating application
          scripts.

1.21_01  2009-12-01 03:34:23
        - Update generated scripts to use the new Catalyst::Script:: classes
          available from Catalyst 5.80014_02.
          Note: Any applications whos scripts are upgraded will need to depend
          on at least this version of Catalyst.
        - Change application templates from being inlined in Catalyst::Helper
          to being in a share dir making the templates much easier to maintain
          and patch.
        - Generate new applications with Moose and Moose style components.
        - Remove dependency on parent.pm as this has been removed from the generated
          application template.
        - Turn off deprecated regex component lookup in the config of new
          applications.
        - Test application generation and helper classes properly.
        - Change tests in generated application and components to use the new
          done_testing feature rather than having test plans.
        - Update required versions of dependencies to ensure the installed versions
          won't cause deprecation warnings with the latest Catalyst.
        - Exclude root/, t/ and hidden dirs from file change monitoring when
          using File::ChangeNotify 0.08+. (dew)
        - Updated POD of Module/Install/Catalyst.pm (Karsten Heymann)
        - Added debian package building temp files to the list
          of ignored files/directories and fix ignore for subversion
          checkouts. (Karsten Heymann)

1.21   2009-10-18 18:33:33
        - The Restarter code caused stack traces for certain types of errors
          to grow longer and longer with every restart. (Dave Rolsky)

        - Fixed an issue with the Restarter in Win32 where @INC didn't get
          passed along when restarting.

1.20    2009-08-11 23:30:30
        - Bump required File::ChangeNotify version to 0.07. Closes RT#48610.

1.19    2009-06-29 00:36:50
        - Update Module::Install to a version that doesn't screw up
          auto_install anymore (Closes: RT#45784).
        - Generate Makefile.PLs with unix-paths, even on windows (Closes:
          RT#46059).

1.18    2009-06-10 17:43:12
        - The forking restarter was not waiting for the child to exit,
          which could lead to a race condition. If the old child did
          not exit before the new child tried to bind to its socket,
          it would find the old child blocking the port it wanted.
        - More fixes for the Win32 restarter. It was effectively
          ignoring all command-line options except those related to
          the restarter itself.

1.17    2009-05-24 18:18:17
        - Catalyst::Restarter::Forking loaded the threads and
          Thread::Cancel modules, even though it doesn't need them.

1.16    2009-05-23 17:29:29
        - Catalyst prereq changed to 5.80. Thanks, kold! (jhannah)
        - Fixed the restarter to actually work on Win32. The fix means
          that the restarter is as slow as ever on Win32, but it
          works. Thanks to Rodrigo for the bug report and suggestion
          on how to fix it. (Dave Rolsky)
        - Actually fix -p option for port number, as I failed to do it
          right last time as I'm an idiot (t0m)

1.15    2009-05-13 20:02
        - Remove -p option for pid file, and restore it to the port number,
          as it should be -port|-p (t0m)
        - Document -pidfile in myapp_server.pl POD (t0m)

1.14_02 2009-05-11 04:29
        - Small changes to work with File::ChangeNotify 0.03. (Dave
          Rolsky)

1.14_01 2009-05-11 03:45
        - This release moves the restarter functionality into a new
          module Catalyst::Restarter, that is not a Catalyst Engine
          subclass.

          The new restarter is simpler and more reliable, because it
          does not try to test if a changed piece of code can be
          compiled. It simply restarts the server whenever it detects
          changes. This also makes it much faster.

          However, this does mean that the server can simply die when
          a changed file cannot compile. This is different than the
          old behavior, where the server remained running without
          incorporating the change.

          Finally, the new restarter relies on File::ChangeNotify,
          which is designed to accomodate per-OS methods of detecting
          changed files. As of this writing, it currently ships with a
          file watcher that uses inotify on Linux systems, and a
          default fallback class that does everything in pure Perl.
          (Dave Rolsky)

1.04    2008-04-06 16:04:00
        - Update default actions in Root.pm
        - Patch Helper.pm so Module::Pluggable::Object ignores emacs temp
          files appropriately for restarting server
