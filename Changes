1.16    2009-05-23 17:29:29
        - Catalyst prereq changed to 5.80. Thanks, kold! (jhannah)
        - Fixed the restarter to actually work on Win32. The fix means
          that the restarter is as slow as ever on Win32, but it
          works. Thanks to Rodrigo for the bug report and suggestion
          on how to fix it. (Dave Rolsky)
        - Actually fix -p option for port number, as I failed to do it
          right last time as I'm an idiot (t0m)

1.15    2009-05-13 20:02
        - Remove -p option for pid file, and restore it to the port number,
          as it should be -port|-p (t0m)
        - Document -pidfile in myapp_server.pl POD (t0m)

1.14_02 2009-05-11 04:29
        - Small changes to work with File::ChangeNotify 0.03. (Dave
          Rolsky)

1.14_01 2009-05-11 03:45
        - This release moves the restarter functionality into a new
          module Catalyst::Restarter, that is not a Catalyst Engine
          subclass.

          The new restarter is simpler and more reliable, because it
          does not try to test if a changed piece of code can be
          compiled. It simply restarts the server whenever it detects
          changes. This also makes it much faster.

          However, this does mean that the server can simply die when
          a changed file cannot compile. This is different than the
          old behavior, where the server remained running without
          incorporating the change.

          Finally, the new restarter relies on File::ChangeNotify,
          which is designed to accomodate per-OS methods of detecting
          changed files. As of this writing, it currently ships with a
          file watcher that uses inotify on Linux systems, and a
          default fallback class that does everything in pure Perl.
