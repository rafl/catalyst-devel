15:36 <t0m> right. so the first thing to do is probably write a test to check 
            generating an application doesn't change.
15:37 <dhoss> per app?
15:38 <t0m> no, I mean whilst you're ripping ::Helper apart.
15:38 <dhoss> OH
15:38 <dhoss> gotcha 
15:38 <t0m> if you install your branch.. Then catalyst.pl t/TestAppForComparison
15:39 <dhoss> so we have the same results now as before, yes?
15:39 <t0m> then you write a test which says catalyst.pl /tmp/TempTestApp; my 
            $diff = `diff -urN t/TestAppForComparison /tmp/TempTestApp`; ok 
            !length($diff) or warn $diff;
15:40 <t0m> exactly. and that'll test you rip all of the files out of Helper.pm 
            correctly..
15:40 <dhoss> okay, TestAppForComparison created. i'll commit that initial 
              version
15:40 <t0m> you'll probably want to nuke it after that, as testing the 
            generated strings of an entire app dir is gonna be a PITA
15:41 <t0m> to maintain
15:41 <dhoss> i could see that
15:41 <t0m> But it's totally the right solution whilst you're trying to rip 
            stuff out without changing it
15:41 <dhoss> temp testing :-D
15:44 <t0m> I've got some ideas on doing better testing that the TestApp we 
            generate is good.
15:44 <t0m> but they're a bit more involved, and not needed for this at all ;)
15:45 <dhoss> this being this refactor, or this bit of the refactor?
15:45 <t0m> the latter.
15:45 <dhoss> okay - got it
15:46 <t0m> and once this is done - you can branch again to work on the code, 
            and again to work on the generated app templates (as we'll want to 
            moosify those, so your app is moosetastic by default
15:46 <t0m> and as it's all in different files - you can do both in parallel as 
            you feel like and safely merge back
15:47 <t0m> did you get to grips with MX::GetOpt and do you have a plan for 
            that yet?
15:48 <dhoss> so one branch for helper_refactor, one for code (which code?), 
              and one for app templates
15:48 <t0m> As I guess catalyst.pl should be taught to use it, and so should 
            the generated scripts :)
15:48 <dhoss> i've been playing with MX::GetOpt, i need a few more details on 
              what exactly needs to be beat up
15:48 <t0m> yy, but you branch from completed helper_refactor :)
15:49 <t0m> and 'code' is the actual refactor / api changes for helpers
15:49 <t0m> bletch
15:50 <dhoss> okay, so the 'code' branch will be simply the C::H code branched 
              from helper_refactor
15:50 <t0m> get_file has to keep working as everything using ::Helper needs it
15:50 <t0m> yes, exactly.
15:51 <t0m> so you need to make a get_file_from_sharedir function or something
15:51 <dhoss> okay, making sense now :-)
15:51 <t0m> and change things over to use that.
15:51 <t0m> that's fine though - means you can extract 1 file at a time
15:52 <dhoss> which would be better, no? better atomicity and for testing
15:52 <t0m> yy
15:52 <t0m> bletch was at the fact that 'get_file' is a good method name, and 
            it's now deprecated
15:53 <dhoss> is that in C::H?
15:53 <t0m> yy
15:53  * dhoss is a little behind in my api knowledge
15:53 <dhoss> off the top of my head at least
15:53 <t0m> it's the 'get me a file out the <DATA> section' method
15:53 <dhoss> aha right
15:54 <t0m> which you're replacing in favour of 'get me a file out of the share 
            dir'
15:54 <t0m> and 'copy file out of sharedir' methods.
15:54 <t0m> The former for templates
15:54 <t0m> the latter for binaries, which gets rid of the hateful decoding and 
            writing out business
15:54 <dhoss> get -> we're going to interpolate shit, copy -> we're giong to 
              use directly?
15:55 <t0m> just so
15:55 <t0m> eliminating the 'please turn this giant hex string back into 
            binary' thing
15:55 <dhoss> definitely :-P
16:00 <t0m> sub _mk_favicon {
16:00 <t0m>     my ( $self ) = @_;
16:00 <t0m>     $self->copy_share_file(
16:00 <t0m>         File::Spec->catfile( ( caller(0) )[0], 'favicon.ico' ),
16:00 <t0m>         File::Spec->catfile( $self->{root}, "favicon.ico" )
16:00 <t0m>     );
16:00 <t0m> }
16:00 <t0m> sumfin like dat
16:01 <dhoss> easy enough
16:01 <t0m> the actually, all the caller crap dies too
16:02 <dhoss> hrm, i suppose we have to keep the atrocious 
              Class::Accessor::Fast method name artifacts?
16:02 <t0m> that's to clue get_file what file to borg crap out off
16:03 <t0m> I vote that most of them can burn, as we'll be working out what 
            shit to copy a lot more dynamically
16:03 <t0m> and the ones which can't get deprecated, but preserved.
16:04 <dhoss> so that's just for the current get_file, right? 
16:04 <t0m> yy
16:04 <t0m>     $self->copy_share_file(
16:04 <t0m>         'favicon.ico',
16:04 <t0m>         File::Spec->catfile( $self->{root}, "favicon.ico" )
16:04 <t0m>     );
16:05 <t0m> more like it
16:05 <t0m> so we have sub mk_foo { shift->generate_foo(@_); }

====
5-28
03:04 < dhoss> SO. official next step: 1) trim crap out 2) write test for how 
               helpers are invoking Catalyst::Helper 3)??? 4) profit!
03:05 < t0m> 3) Re arrange files in sharedir so we can make the comversion guts 
             totally generic
03:05 < t0m> 4) merge&profit
03:05 < t0m> *conversion
03:05 < dhoss> rearrange meaning mv foo MyApp?
03:06 < t0m> erm, yes, as described above, so that the contents of share/ is 
             laid out the same as a newly generated MyApp
03:06 < dhoss> OH
03:06 < dhoss> okay
03:06 < dhoss> instead of my current fuckery :-)
03:06 < dhoss> autarch: btw if you have an idea for that i'd love an email to 
               the one in topic
03:06 < t0m> cause then the entire generate application becomes 'copy this 
             directory from X => Y, applying some file mangling rules)
